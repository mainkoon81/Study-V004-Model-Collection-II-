### [Note] Variations on supervised and unsupervised Model ?
 - Semi-Supervised Learning:
   - we have a bunch of pairs (**x**1,**y**1), (**x**2,**y**2), ...(**x**_i,**y**_i), and then we are additionally given more x values such as x_i+1, x_i+2,..up to x_n. Our task is to predict `y_i+1`, `y_i+2`,..up to `y_n`.
 - Reinforcement Learning:
   - Investigate the "reward/loss"(long/short term payoff) associated with a certain action or state..
### [Note] PGM ?
If you are keen on studying generative models and delving deeper into them, I would say concepts and thorough knowledge on Probabilistic graphical models is essential. If your focus is on Discriminative models or planning to use deep learning as a blackbox then you can get away without PGM and its probably not very essential. But if you are planning for a research either in implicit or explicit generative models or especially deep generative models, then I strongly recommend PGM as a course. Its a valuable tool for sure.

# Generative VS Discriminative Model
Machine Learning models can be typically divided into two types. Discriminative and Generative models. Discriminative models deal with classification or categorization of the data, examples include SVMs, linear/logistic regression, CRFs etc. Generative approaches model how the data is generated and various other tasks can be further addressed with this generative information, examples include HMMs, GMM, Boltzman machines. Deep learning models such as DBMs, Variational Auto-encoders are again generative models.
 - __[A]. Generative algorithm:__ learning each structure, and then classifying it using the knowledge you just gained.
   - A generative model is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on `P(X,Y)` and Classifiers are computed using probablistic models.
   - Generative modeling means building a model that can generate new examples that come from the same distribution as the training data (or that can look at an input example and report the likelihood of it being generated by that distribution). This means generative modeling is a kind of unsupervised learning.
   - A generative algorithm models uses the data to create a **`probabilities`**, and how the data was "generated", so you ask it "what's the likelihood this or that class generated this instance?" and pick the one with the **better probability**. 
     - Estimate joint probability ### P(Y, X) = P(Y|X)f(X) = f(X|Y)P(Y) 
       - where Y is label(class), `f() is pdf` and `P() is class marginal probability`.
       - `f(X|Y)P(Y)` : first choose a class, then given the class, we choose(generate) the point X. 
       - P(Y|X)f(X) : first choose the point X, then given the point, we choose a class. This is discriminative though. 
     - Estimates not only probability of labels but also the features
     - Once model is fit, can be used to generate data
     - LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes, etc
     - (-) Often works worse, particularly when assumptions are violated
   
 - __[B]. Discriminative algorithm:__ determining the difference in the each without learning the structure, and then classifying the data_point.
   - A discriminative model is a statistical model of the conditional probability distribution on `P(Y|X=x)` and Classifiers computed **without using a probability model** are also referred to loosely as "discriminative".
   - A discriminative algorithm uses the data to create a **`decision boundary`**, so you ask it "what side of the decision boundary is this instance on?" So it doesn't create a model of how the data was generated, it makes a model of what it thinks the boundary between classes looks like.

Since **discriminative** cares `P(Y|X)` only, while **generative** cares `P(X,Y) and P(X)` at the same time, in order to predict **P(Y|X)** well, the generative model has **`less degree of freedom`** in the model compared to discriminative model. So generative model is more robust, less prone to overfitting while discriminative is the other way around. So **discriminative models** usually tend to do better if you have `lots of data`; **generative models** may be better if you have some extra `unlabeled or missing data`(the generative model has its own advantages such as the capability of dealing with missing data).

## A> Generative Analysis

 - Rule-based Classification Algorithm:
   - As a **Supervised method**, labels are used to learn the `data structure` which allows the **classification** of future observations.
   - LDA(parametric), QDA
   - LDA
   - KNN
### 1. LDA_01. Linear Discriminant Analysis
# `P(g|x)`
 - Predict the membership of the given vector `x`. 
 - We have a dataset containing lots of vector observations(rows) and their labels. 
 - What's the probability that the new vector observation `x` belongs to the Grp `g`? (p is the dimension of the vector x).
 - This probabilities come from a certain **likelihood distribution of Grp**(with different parametrization)...in detail, 
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52278515-2156c280-294f-11e9-9bc2-6e40c4563b8f.jpg" />

 - So let's figure out the Likelihood distribution `P(x|g)`. This is the distribution of data points in each group. If we know the **distribution of x in each Grp: `P(x|g)`**, we can classify the new p-dimensional data points given in the future...so done and dusted. What if choosing the Grp_feature distribution `P(x|g)` as **multivariate Gaussian** ? (Of course, in the multivariate version, `µ` is a mean vector and σ is replaced by a covariance matrix `Σ`).
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52270233-3d9b3500-2938-11e9-9585-63ef137328a4.jpg" />

# two functions to maximize `P(g|x)`.
 - Assumption: **all Grp share the equal `Σ` matrix**(in QDA, the equal covariance assumption does not hold, thus you cannot drop `-0.5log(|Σ|)` term).  
 - Which 'g' has the highest probability of owning the new p-dimensional datapoint? 
   - Eventually, Min/Max depends on the unique parameter(`µ,Σ`) of each Grp. 
   - When you plug in x vector, `µ,Σ` that minimizing **Mahalonobis Distance**, is telling you the membership of the vector `x`.  
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52273637-57417a00-2942-11e9-8881-f7279ec947d4.jpg" />
   
   - When you plug in x vector, `µ,Σ` that maximizing **LD-function**, is telling you the membership of the vector `x`.
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52273639-59a3d400-2942-11e9-900e-077ceabfb0b9.jpg" />

 > **Log Odd Ratio** and `Linear Decision Boundary`
   - What if the Grp membership probability of 'g1', 'g2' are the same? 
   - Then we can say that the given vector point is the part of `Linear Decision Boundary` !!!
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52283578-a2678700-295a-11e9-98ae-817a9f91afdc.jpg" />

 > LDA and Logistic regression
   - LDA is Generative while LogisticRegression is discriminative.
   - LDA operates by maximizing the log-likelihood based on an assumption of normality and homogeneity while Logistic regression makes no assumption about P(X), and estimates the parameters of P(g|x) by maximizing the conditional likelihood. 
   - logistic regression would presumably be more robust if LDA’s distributional assumptions (Gaussian?) are violated. 
   - In principle, LDA should perform poorly when outliers are present, as these usually cause problems when assuming normality. 
   - In LDA, the log-membership odd between Grps are **linear functions** of the vector data x. This is due to the assumption of `Gaussian densities` and `common covariance matrices`.
   - In LogisticRegression, the log-membership odd between Grps are **linear functions** of the vector data x as well.

### 2. LDA_02. Latent Dirichlet Allocation
The finite Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over distributions, namely over multinomial distributions. That means if you draw a sample from it, you get a random distribution. A loaded die can be described by a `multinomial distribution`. A machine that makes biased die with some random error can be described by a `Dirichlet distribution`. Suppose there are boxes with chocolates, with some portion of dark and sweet chocolates. You pick at random one of the boxes(perhaps some kinds of boxes can be more common than others. Then, you can pick at random one of the chocolates. So you have a distribution (a collection of boxes) of distributions (chocolates in a box). 
 - Just as the beta distribution is the conjugate prior for a binomial likelihood, the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the multinomial likelihood. It can be thought of as a **multivariate beta distribution** for a collection of probabilities (that must sum to 1). 
   
LDA is a “generative probabilistic model” of a collection of **composites made up of parts**. 
 - The composites are `documents`.
 - The **topics** are Latent Variable. 
 - The parts are `words`  
 - `Document` is a distribution over `topics`. 
 - `Topic` is a distribution of `words`.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/67500637-e7635300-f67a-11e9-93f5-ff72ffa0a04b.jpg" />

The probabilistic topic model estimated by LDA consists of two tables (matrices):
 - 1st table: the probability of selecting a particular `part(word)` when sampling a particular **topic(category)**.
 - 2nd table: the probability of selecting a particular **topic(category)** when sampling a particular `document`.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31917400/52525957-842abf80-2ca9-11e9-8465-b36a9e1d2d4e.jpg" />

 - > In the chart above, every topic is given the same alpha value. Each dot represents some distribution or mixture of the three topics like (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) or (0.4, 0.3, 0.3). Remember that each sample has to add up to one. At low alpha values (less than one), most of the topic distribution samples are in the corners (near the topics). For really low alpha values, it’s likely you’ll end up sampling (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0, 0.0), or (0.0, 0.0, 1.0). This would mean that a document would only ever have one topic if we were building a three topic probabilistic topic model from scratch.
 - > At alpha equal to one, any space on the surface of the triangle (2-simplex) is fair game (uniformly distributed). You could equally likely end up with a sample favoring only one topic, a sample that gives an even mixture of all the topics, or something in between. For alpha values greater than one, the samples start to congregate to the center. This means that as alpha gets bigger, your samples will more likely be uniform or an even mixture of all the topics.
 
 - WTF? __Simplest Generative Procedure:__

   - Pick your unique set of WORDS.
   - Pick how many DOCUMENTS you want.
   - Pick how many WORDS you want per each DOCUMENT (sample from a Poisson distribution).
   - Pick how many `topics`(categories or label) you want.
   - Pick a number between not zero and positive infinity and call it **alpha**.
   - Pick a number between not zero and positive infinity and call it **beta**.
   - Build the `**WORDS** VS **topics** table`. 
     - For each column, draw a sample(spin the wheel) from a Dirichlet distribution using **beta** as the input. The Dirichlet distribution takes a number called **beta** for each `topic` (or category). 
     - Each sample will fill out each column in the table, sum to one, and give the probability of each part per `topic`(column).
   - Build the `**DOCUMENTS** VS **topics** table`. 
     - For each row, draw a sample from a Dirichlet distribution using **alpha** as the input. The Dirichlet distribution takes a number called alpha for each `topic` (or category).
     - Each sample will fill out each row in the table, sum to one, and give the probability of each `topic` (column) per DOCUMENT.
   - Build the actual DOCUMENTS. For each DOCUMENT:
     - Step_1) look up its **row** in the `**DOCUMENT** VS **topics** table`, 
     - Step_2) sample a `topic` based on the probabilities in the row, 
     - Step_3) go to the `**WORDS** VS **topics** table`, 
     - Step_4) look up the `topic` sampled, 
     - Step_5) sample a **WORD** based on the probabilities in the column, 
     - Step_6) repeat from step 2 until you’ve reached how many WORDS this DOCUMENT was set to have.
